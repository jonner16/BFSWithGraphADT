# BFSWithGraphADT
Implemented Graph ADT to develop a path finding algorithm (BFS).
Given a list of inputs (under the name input2.in) using BFS the algorithm will determine the shortest path between the start and end points provided in the input file.
The program will then output the number of steps and which steps (e.x. right, left, up or down) it took to get from the start to the end.
